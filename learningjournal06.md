How to use objects and methods
Call a method of an object

The . in between is the member operator 
Used to access the member of an object 
write(‘good afternoon’) is the method
write() allows new content to be written into the page where the script element is located 
The ‘Good afternoon’ is a parameter
Paramater is a piece of information given to the method

Variables
Where scripts store bits of info/data that it needs to execute its job
First need to declare the variable by creating it and giving it a name
Var quantity;
Var is the variable keyword
Quantity is the variable name we’re giving it
Keyword is something that javascript interpreter knows is being used to create a variable
Use camelcase for variable names with more tha none word
Assigning values to variables
Tells it what information you want it to store
Example quantity = 3;
Quantity is variable name
3 is variable value
= is the assignment operator
Tells js we’re going to assign a value to the variable
If you don’t assign a value to a variable it is considered undefined
