Javascript allows for interactivity by...
Accessing content
select any element, attribute or text from an HTML page
Modifying content
add elements, attributes, and text to the page or remove them
Setting program rules
Specify a set of steps for browser to follow
Reacting to events
Specify when to run a certain script, for example when a specific event has occurred like a button is pressed
Script
Series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal
To write a script, first state the goal then list the tasks that need to be completed to achieve the goal
1.Define the goal
2.Design the script
Using flowchart
3.Code each step
Syntax
How exactly to put words together to create instructions that computers can follow
Programmatic approach
Computers follow a series of instructions one after another, 
Expressions
Evaluates to one single value
2 kinds
Just assign a value to a variable
Var color = ‘beige’;
The value of color is now beige
Use two or more values to return a single value
Var area = 3 * 2;
Rely on operators
Operators
Allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
Assignment operators
Assign value to variable
Color = ‘beige’;
Arithmetic operators
Perform basic math
Area = 3 * 2;
The value of area is now 6
Addition +
Subtraction -
Division /
Multiplication *
Increment ++
Decrement --
Modulus % (returns the remainder, ie 10%3 is 1)
String operators
The + symbol combines two strings
Greeting = ‘Hi ‘ + ‘Molly’;
The value of greeting is now Hi Molly
Comparison operators
Compare 2 values and return true or false
Buy = 3 > 5;
The value of buy is false
Logical operators
Combine expressions and return true or false
Buy = (5 > 3) && (2 <4);
The value of buy is now true
Functions
Call function to ask it to perform task
Pass in information to it via parameters
Return value is the response you get from running the function
Declare by
Giving it a name and writing the statements needed to do its task inside curly braces
Call function by functionName();
Function declaration
You can call later in your code
Function area(width, height) {
Function expression
If you put it where an expression would normally go
Var area = function(width, height) {
Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
No name
Executed once as the interpreter comes across it
Variable scope
Local scope 
If variable is created inside function it cannot be accessed outside of the function
Global scope
If variable is created outside of function
Object
Groups together a set of variables and functions to create a model
Variables in object become properties
Functions become methods
Key
The name of the property or method
Has a corresponding value
Name: ‘Quay’ 
Name is the key and the value is quay
