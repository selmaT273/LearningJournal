What makes a computer a computer
Has to perform 4 different tasks
Take input
Stuff that you do that makes the computer do stuff
Mic, camera, touch screen, etc. 
Store information
Storage
Store as data
Process it
Processor takes info from memory using an algorithim and then sends it to be stored in memory again until it becomes output
Output results
Text, photos, videos, etc.
Made out of wood and metal at first
Started out as basic calculators
Only manipulating numbers
Binary and Data
Computers work on ones and zeroes
Wires and circuits carry all info on computer
Wires can transmit bits
More bits means more complex info
Binary number system
Only 2 digits ( 0 and 1 )
Each number has a position but it multiplies by 2 unlike the decimal system in which each position multiplies by 10
Any number can be represented with 1s and 0s 
Or by wires that are on or off
With 32 wires you can store numbers from 0 to over 4 billion
Text, pictures and sound can also be represented with 1s and 0s

Circuits and Logic
Every input and output is a type of info that can be represented by 1s and 0s
Processes the information and output it it has to combine the signals using many tiny components that come together on a circuit
A simple circuit
Takes an electrical signal and flips it
Circuits can take multiple signals and combine them to produce a different result
Logic gates
Adder
Circuit that takes in 2 bits and adds together to calculate the sum
Multiple adders side by side can add larger numbers
The smaller the circuit, the less time it takes for the signal needs to travel, therefore is faster

CPU, Memory, Input, and Output
Input devices convert input from outside world and convert to binary info
Keypad, camera, microphone, gps
Memory stores this info


Cpu is where all calculations are done 
Calculates how to process the input then stores it to memory
Receives simple binary commands that tell it which circuit to use
Output devices convert info into physical output
Like speaker produces sound

Hardware and Software
Hardware includes
Circuits
Chips
Wires
Speakers
Plugs
Software includes
Apps
Games
Websites
Maps
Creative
Analysis
CPU is the master chip that controls all other parts of the computer
Has small parts that handles certain tasks
Math and logic
Send and receive
Binary code is the most basic form of software
Controls all hardware of a computer
Not used anymore
Programming languages let you type out high level commands converted into hundreds and thousands of simpler binary commands that the CPU understands
