## Basic Text Editors
A text editor is a must-have tool for any developer however, with a slew of options available, it is important to find which one works best for you. A text editor in its most basic form allows you to write and manage code. You may be familiar with the default text editor that came with your computer, and while those are technically text editors, they are not optimal for writing code for several reasons. Firstly, they don't incorporate important features that optimize efficiency such as code completion, as well as syntax highlighting. Additionally, they do not include any additional viewing options (themes) to reduce eye strain. 
## Code-Specific Text Editors
There are numerous code-specific text editors that are made available to you via third-party options which go beyond the functionality of the basic text editors discussed above. They are the status quo in the field of programming and can be easily downloaded to your computer. Code-specific text editors can edit any text but offer features to optimize user experience, functionality, and efficiency. For example, there is usually syntax highlighting, theme options for ideal viewing, as well as built in extentions to other handy tools. 
## IDE
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment)is a conglomoration of very important developer tools all wrapped into one software. An IDE works with code but also serves as a text editor, file manager, debugger, has automated build processes and can locate and utilize compilers. While IDEs provide increased efficiency, they are not optimal for beginner programmers and do not offer some important features that a text editor provides for catching syntax errors.
