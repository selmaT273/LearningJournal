### Growth Mindset
A **growth mindset** is having the ability to perceive adverse situations as an opportunity for learning and improvement, while also maintaining an internal locus of control. It requires the ability to let yourself feel out of your comfort zone.

### Maintaining a Growth Mindset
There are many strategies that one could use to remind themselves to stay in a growth mindset, as one might find themselves falling prey to a fixed mindset. For example, if I am feeling as if I want to give up on a problem that I've been struggling with for an extended amount of time, it would be wise to step away from it and return after a while with fresh eyes. Another way I can remain in a growth mindset when I'm feeling like I failed at something or didn't do as well as I thought is to have a retrospective with myself and ask myself "what are some things that went well?" "what didn't go well?" and "how can I improve on those things next time?". Lastly, as tempting as it may be to unnecessarily place on blame external factors for a problem or failure, it would be more useful to uphold a growth mindset by reminding myself of what factors I am in control of.
